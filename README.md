## Lung Cancer Overview - Power BI Dashboard  

### **Description:**  
This Power BI dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of lung cancer cases across different demographics and risk factors. The dashboard includes key performance indicators (KPIs) and various visualizations to help users gain insights into the prevalence, risk factors, and mortality rates associated with lung cancer.  

### **Key Metrics & Visuals:**  
- **KPIs (Displayed using Cards):**  
  - **Total Lung Cancer Cases:** 8.961K  
  - **Average Age of Lung Cancer Patients:** 52.66 years  
  - **Percentage of Smokers with Lung Cancer:** 7.07%  
  - **Mortality Rate for Lung Cancer Patients:** 75.09%  

- **Visualizations:**  
  - **Lung Cancer Cases by Country** (Horizontal Bar Chart)  
  - **Lung Cancer Cases by Gender** (Pie Chart)  
  - **Age Distribution of Lung Cancer Patients** (Vertical Bar Chart)  
  - **Smoking Impact Score by Gender** (Stacked Bar Chart)  
  - **Mortality Rate vs. Air Pollution Exposure** (Pie Chart)  
  - **Lung Cancer Risk Score Distribution** (Area Chart)  

- **Slicers:**  
  - Users can filter data by various parameters such as country, gender, age group, smoking habits, and pollution levels for better analysis.

### **Business Insights:**  
1. **Gender Impact:** Lung cancer cases are significantly higher in males compared to females. This highlights the need for targeted awareness and prevention campaigns for high-risk male populations.  
2. **Age Factor:** The majority of lung cancer patients fall within the **20-30 years age group**, which may indicate an early onset of the disease or increased risk factors in younger populations. This suggests the need for early screening initiatives.  
3. **Smoking Influence:** The **smoking impact score is higher in males** than females, indicating that smoking is a major contributor to lung cancer cases, especially in men.  
4. **Geographical Trends:** The **top 5 countries with the highest lung cancer cases** are **Ethiopia, Japan, Turkey, Nigeria, and the USA**. This emphasizes the need for region-specific healthcare strategies.  
5. **Air Pollution & Mortality Rate:** The **mortality rate remains same across all levels of air pollution exposure (High, Medium, Low)**, suggesting that factors beyond pollution, such as late-stage diagnosis and healthcare access, may contribute to high mortality.  
6. **Lung Cancer Risk Score:** The risk score distribution analysis can help in identifying high-risk populations and implementing early intervention strategies.  

This dashboard serves as a powerful analytical tool for researchers, healthcare professionals, and policymakers to understand lung cancer trends and develop targeted prevention and treatment plans.
